#DIP: Differentiable Interreflection-aware Physics-based Inverse Rendering



## Checkpoints

I just uploaded the checkpoints of my model. Just in case I accidentally delete everything with rm.

* [geometry initialization](https://github.com/denghilbert/DIP/tree/main/checkpoints/geometry_initialization)
* [joint training of inverse rendering](https://github.com/denghilbert/DIP/tree/main/checkpoints/joint_train)



## Code

* I am cleaning my code from [![State-of-the-art Shitcode](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=State-of-the-art&message=Shitcode&color=7B5804)](https://github.com/trekhleb/state-of-the-art-shitcode)
